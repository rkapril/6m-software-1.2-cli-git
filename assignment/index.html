      <p>I begin to discover my interest in programming when the covid-19 hits. I begin to learn Basic HTML from Udemy. After that i was got invited to Lithan Academy and got introduced to Data Science. When i started learning their intro to python course, it was challenging for me. All the programming concepts seems new to me as i took accounting and finance for my Bachelor Degree. However, I continue to learn and practice. I begin to learn maths, statistics, visualization as well as SQL, python & R programming from their Data Science course. After that i went to took a couples of short courses funded by IBF related to Data Science, Specialist Diploma in businsess analyics at Republic Polytechic & fitst half of Specialist Diploma in Applied AI at Nanyang Polytechnic. I found out that the math and statistics is too much for me to absorb. Eventually, i came to a decision of doing software development. I have also have a plan of building something like a product related to analytics or AI. Training a model can be very time consuming and expensive. I hope this course can help me to learn more about software engineering prospect and i am able to build & deploy data science or AI product in the future. </p>
