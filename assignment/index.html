      <p>I discovered my interest in programming when the covid-19 hits. I begin to learn Basic HTML from Udemy. After that i got invited to Lithan Academy and got introduced Data Science. When i started learning their intro to python course, it was challenging for me. However, I continue to learn and practice. I begin to pick up maths, statistics as well as SQL, python & R programming. After learning all the Data Science concepts, i become very confused. I have been thinking of deploying my trained model into production but i found out there is a challenge. I hope this course can help me to learn more about software engineering prospect and i am able to build & deploy data science or AI product in the future. </p>
